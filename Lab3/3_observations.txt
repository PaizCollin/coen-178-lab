Part 1:
1. The query outputs every empno and empname in the L_EMP table. No, the results are not correct because the two tables need to be linked together somehow to obtain the correct empNo from the L_EMP table, as the deptname from the L_DEPT.

2. Yes, this query outputs the correct results because it actually links the tables together based off of their deptId

3. Yes, this query outputs the correct results as well because instead of linking the tables directly, the subquery returns a single value (deptId) that the query can check against. 

4. No, this query does not work because the subquery returns multiple values, so we cannot check if L_EMP.deptId equals the output from the subquery; we must instead check that by using the IN keyword.

5. Yes, the query outputs the correct results because it checks if the deptId is in the subquery, not equal to the subquery.

9. Yes, after adding the four new rows, the query still works properly. 

Part 2:
12. No, this query does not work because the subquery returns more than one row. The query can be fixed by using the IN keyword rather than an = operator to compare the salary to the salaries returned by the subquery. As a result of this change, there are 67 rows (salaries that match that of one of the Youngs') in the output.
